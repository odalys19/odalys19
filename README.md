- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @odalys19
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in pop culture i.e. anything having to do with television, film, and music, medicine, and just different topics. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a pre-med student that wants to pick up some coding/blogging skills as a hobby.
-             All my previous coding experience has been in bioinformatic analysis with R coding, so this is a brand new field for me!
